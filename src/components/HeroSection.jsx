          I'm a software engineer based in Toronto, Canada and also a
          communication and journalism student. I enjoy creating things that
          live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or
          anything in between. I have been freelancing for a year now while
          studying at the university and I've manage to gain a decent amount of
          experience and valuable knowledge from all different kinds of fields
          throughout my projects/work.
